# Siembra NC Volunteer Management System (VMS)
## Project Proposal & Requirements Document

**Project Name:** Siembra NC Volunteer Management System
**Date:** November 22, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase
**Document Version:** 1.0

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the design and development of a Volunteer Management System (VMS) for Siembra NC, an organization dedicated to supporting immigrant communities. The proposed application will streamline volunteer coordination, sighting reporting, and community safety monitoring processes.

---

## 2. Background & Context

Siembra NC works to protect and support immigrant communities through volunteer-driven monitoring and rapid response efforts. The organization currently manages multiple critical processes that involve volunteer coordination, incident reporting, and community safety alerts.

### 2.1 Organizational Need
As volunteer activities scale, manual coordination and data management present increasing logistical challenges. A centralized digital platform will improve efficiency, data accuracy, and response times while reducing administrative burden.

---

## 3. Current Processes

Siembra NC currently maintains the following operational processes:

### 3.1 Volunteer Management
- **Volunteer Mailing List:** Communication channel for volunteer outreach and updates
- **Vetted Volunteer List:** Roster of volunteers with training completion and role qualifications
- **Training & Role Qualification:** System for tracking volunteer certifications and capabilities

### 3.2 Shift Coordination
- **Shift Signup Coordination:** Management of volunteer shift opportunities
- **Invite Creation:** Generation and distribution of shift invitations
- **RSVP Management:** Tracking volunteer commitments to shifts
- **Volunteer Availability:** Recording and managing volunteer availability schedules

### 3.3 Sighting & Incident Management
- **Database of Sightings:** Record of reported incidents and their disposition status
- **Intake Process:** Standardized workflow for receiving sighting reports
- **Dispatch Coordination:** Assignment of response teams to verified incidents
- **Disposition Recording:** Documentation of incident outcomes (verified, false alarm, etc.)
- **Publication to Ojo:** Distribution of verified information to the community

---

## 4. Problem Statement

While Siembra NC has established processes, current tools may not provide:
- **Centralized data management** across all volunteer and incident operations
- **Real-time coordination** for time-sensitive dispatch and response

## 11. Appendices

### Appendix A: Glossary
- **Ojo:** Community alert/publication system
- **Sighting:** Reported incident requiring verification
- **Disposition:** Final status of an incident (verified, false alarm, etc.)
- **Dispatch:** Assignment of response team to incident
- **Vetted Volunteer:** Volunteer who has completed required training

### Appendix B: Open Questions & Answers

#### Q1: What is the current volume of volunteers and incidents?
**Answer:** Approximately 100 field volunteers working across 10 different zones (~10 volunteers per zone average)

**Implications:**
- Zone-based organization is critical for system design
- All major interfaces should include zone filtering and assignment
- Coordinators may be assigned to specific zones
- Reporting and analytics should support zone-level breakdowns
- Shift creation should default to zone-based volunteer matching

#### Q2: What existing tools/platforms are currently in use?
**Answer:** Conversations for each zone currently take place using Signal for encrypted, direct messaging. Signal will continue to play a role in real-time field coordination.

**Implications:**
- VMS should complement (not replace) Signal
- VMS handles: formal notifications, shift scheduling, incident logging, official records, Ojo publication
- Signal handles: real-time encrypted communication, field coordination, urgent updates
- Integration approach: VMS can reference Signal groups and provide links to zone-specific channels
- Volunteers need both tools: VMS for structure/records, Signal for real-time communication

**Integration Strategy:**
- Shift details include reference to zone's Signal group
- Incident assignments include link to join zone coordination channel
- Field responders use Signal for real-time updates, VMS for official verification
- Coordinators can send VMS notifications that point volunteers to Signal for details

#### Q3: What are the specific fields required for Ojo publication?
**Status:** To be determined with Siembra NC and Ojo platform team

**Key considerations:**
- Location (with privacy controls - exact vs. general area)
- Incident type and description
- Verification status and timestamp
- Alert duration and priority level
- Multi-language support (English/Spanish)

#### Q4: Are there any compliance or legal requirements for data retention?
**Status:** To be determined with Siembra NC legal/compliance team

**Key considerations:**
- Incident records retention period
- Volunteer personal information (PII) handling
- Right to be forgotten (data deletion requests)
- Audit log retention
- Backup and recovery requirements

#### Q5: What are the different volunteer roles and their specific qualifications?
**Status:** To be determined with Siembra NC training team

**Initial identified roles:**
- Monitor: Basic field observation (requires initial training + safety protocols)
- Team Lead: Coordinates field teams (requires monitor certification + team lead training)
- Dispatcher: Handles incident intake and team assignment (requires specialized training)
- Coordinator: Manages volunteers and shifts (staff role with administrative access)

**Training requirements to be defined:**
- Initial orientation curriculum
- Safety protocols certification
- Communication training details
- Team lead certification requirements
- Advanced response training scope
